1) We would like to archive and compress all of the files that are larger than
   5 meg. After making the archive, those files need to be removed from the 
   system, and the archive needs to be moved to the flash memory that is already
   attached to our /media/TOSHIBA7.4 folder.
   For your information, moving a file to your flash memory can be simply done
   by:
   mv  your_file /media/TOSHIBA7.4/




2) Please show how to empty the entire /tmp directory after reboot.
   NOTE: you need to use the cron facility to do this task.
