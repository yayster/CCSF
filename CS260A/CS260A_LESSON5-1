Account Management in Unix/Linux
--------------------------------

In this lesson, we would like to talk about account management.
Account management is the ability of creating, modifying and deleting users accounts.
To do that, we need to have the root privilege.

One of the important jobs of any sys-admin is managing users accounts. 
For example, creating accounts, delete accounts, lock and unlock accounts. enforce
passwords, create groups, delete groups, and so forth.
You need to be familiar with the following tools:

useradd, groupadd, usermod, groupmod, userdel, groups, and groupdel.

The following sites are showing you how to use the above commands:
