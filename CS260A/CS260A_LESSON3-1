When we login to a Linux box, the login process will save our login information in
/var/log/wtmp and /var/log/utmp.  In the case of invalid login, the information will
be saved in the /var/log/btmp file. 
wtmp keeps the records of all login and logout attempts. But utmp always keeps the
latest one. As a result,  /utmp is the subset of /wtmp.
These files are binary files, and we need some special tools to look at the contents
of these files. The following commands are used to access and display these files:
last, blast , utmpdump.

Some students asked me to recommend a good site for the vim text editor. 
I suggest the following site:

Please put the following alias into your .bash_profile :

alias CS260A='cd /pub/cs/amoghtan/cs260a'

And from now on, just by typing  CS260A  you are able to access our public directory
on hills. In the public directory, you can type:  last_files
to see the latest posted files.

There is a very handy command in Linux called "split". This command is a very useful
tool for any sys-admin and developer. 
What it does is splitting your files into small chunks. 
The following sites would provide some useful
information about "split":

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/split-command-in-linux-with-examples/
https://www.linuxtechi.com/split-command-examples-for-linux-unix/

To glue the files back together, we use the "cat" command.
