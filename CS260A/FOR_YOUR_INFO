Did you know that awk is abbreviated from the names of its developers – Alfred Aho,
Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan? 

The following are the three variations of AWK:

1. Awk
AWK is original AWK written by A. Aho, B. W. Kernighan and P. Weinberger.

2. Nawk
NAWK stands for “New AWK”. This is AT&T’s version of the Awk.

3. Gawk
GAWK stands for “GNU AWK”. All Linux distributions comes with GAWK. This is fully 
compatible with AWK and NAWK.

On Linux, typing either awk or gawk invokes the GAWK. awk is linked to gawk as
shown below on Linux systems.

ls -l /bin/awk /usr/bin/awk
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  4 Jan  5 23:13 /bin/awk -> gawk
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 Jan  5 23:13 /usr/bin/awk -> ../../bin/gawk

How to show all of the function names on Linux
----------------------------------------------
The following function would do the job:

show_functions()
{
   declare -F | awk '{print $NF}' | sort | egrep -v "^_"
}

But the better way is:

The better way is:

compgen -c

To count total number of commands available for us

compgen -c | wc -l


To list all the bash aliases

compgen -a

To list all the bash built-ins

compgen -b

To list all the bash keywords

compgen -k

In the above examples, I am using the compgen command. This command is one of my
favorite command in bash.

The other favorite command is "shopt". This command also belongs to bash and is very
useful in our scripts.

Suppose we have the following shell script:

#!/bin/bash

alias print='echo'

print "hello bash"

when you run the script, you'll receive error message. Your script does not know
what to do with "alias". To fix the problem I'll modify the script:

#!/bin/bash

shopt -s expand_aliases
alias print='echo'

print "hello bash"

shopt -s expand_aliases

Do you know   view <file>  is the same as  vi -R <file>
