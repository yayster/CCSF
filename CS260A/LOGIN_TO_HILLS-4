How to login to hills:


If you are using a Windows 10 PC, strike the Windows key and type "cmd" without the
quotes.

The command prompt app icon should appear, click on that.

You should see a mostly blank screen that by default is black,

with a prompt that probably reads C:\Users\<your login> whatever your local login is.

Type "ssh <your username>@hills.ccsf.edu" and hit "Enter" without the quotes.

Hills will ask for your password. It's your birthday-dot-initials in the following format mmmddyy.fl

for example if Jane Kurtain was born January 21st 1990

her password would be jan2190.jk

Note the use of all lower case letters for the month and the initials.
 

For first time users you may see on your screen:

The authenticity of host 'hills.ccsf.edu (147.144.1.2)' can't be established.

RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:S9gQfX4YbPVLvVSSfxEt4wT3VdI+nNfXHV3Yc8NZ5XA or
something similar.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? Enter yes.

Again you when you click on that icon you should get a mostly blank screen but the

command prompt may look like $/Users/<your login>.
