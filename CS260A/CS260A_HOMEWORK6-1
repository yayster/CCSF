                                    CS260A Homework#6
                                    -----------------

Write a shell script to behave like the "last" command, but it should
also accept the CRN number of a course.  If the CRN is used, then our
script will show the latest login/logoff activity of all of the
students in that class.

For example:

show_them 30821

would display the latest login/logoff activities of the students in
our CS260A class.

In the above example, I assumed the name of our shell script is "show_them".

Some other examples:

show_them        is equivalent to:  last
show_them -f /var/run/utmp     is equivalent to:   last -f /var/run/utmp
show_them -f /var/run/utmp   30821   



I have posted the binary version of this shell script in our public
directory on hills, and renamed it to "nosy".

So, the output and behavior of your shell script should be the same as
"nosy"

DUE DATE: 5/16/22 

I need your source code of the shell script, and some sample outputs.

Please email them to me.
