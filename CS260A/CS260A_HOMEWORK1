                                CS260A Homework #1
                                ------------------

One of the jobs of any sys-admin is writing or modifying shell scripts. 
In this homework assignment, we would like to start practicing with shell scripting.

Very often, a sys-admin needs to create some junk or trash files. For example 
creating 35 files with the size of 200 bytes each. Or create a file with the size
of one mega byte. 
We would like to make a shell script called "mkfiles". This script should be able
to create any number of files, with any size. 
For example:

mkfiles -s 3000 -n 5 -f goody
would generate 5 files with 3000 bytes each. The name of the files would be goody1,
goody2, goody3, goody4, and goody5.

In this script, -f followed by the filename is used to provide the filename.
If the -f option is missing, then the default filename is "noname'.
-n is used for number of files.
If -n is missing, then only one file will be generated.
-s is used to specify the size of the file in bytes.
If -s is missing, then the default file size will be zero.
-h would display the help menu.

mkfiles -h   would display the help menu.

-v would display the names of all of the generated files.

For your information, I have made the binary version of this shell script, and posted
in our public directory on hills. The name of the file is "mkfiles".

To play with that, you need to copy it to your home directory, and then run it.
Your shell script should behave and run similar to the binary that I have provided
for you.

Due date: 1/31/22
You need to email me your shell script, and a sample of output.
