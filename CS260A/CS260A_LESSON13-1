Time, Date and Timezone administration
--------------------------------------
We have 2 types of time. The first one is "system time", and the second one is 
"hardware dlock time".
In the ideal situation, these 2 should be the same, but in some situations they
are different.

At the beginning, we are talking about the system time and date.

The command  timedatectl would provide a comprehensive output about the current
time and timezone.

The /etc/localtime is a symbolic link to binary time identifier in /usr/share/zoneinfo
directory.
ls -l /etc/localtime    would verify that.

To change the timezone, we need to get the list of all timezones in the world.

timedatectl list-timezone  would do it for us.

In California, we are doing the following:

timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles 
In some system (like Ubuntu), we can put  America/Los_Angeles in the file 
/etc/timezone

We can also do the following:
ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo.America/Los_Angeles  /etc/localtime

The command:
tzselect would help the user to select the right timezone.

We can also use:

timedatectl list-timezones

To set the time we do:

timedatectl set-time HH:MM:SS

To set time and date we do:

timedatectl set-time YYYY-MM-DD  HH:MM:SS 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To show the current hardware clock:
hwclock -r

To set the hardware clock to the system clock:
hwclock -w
OR
hwclock --systohc

To set system clock to the hardware clock:

hwclock -s 
OR
hwclock --hctosys

To set the hardware clock manually:

hwclock --set  --date  8/11/2020
OR
hwclock --set  --date  "8/11/2020 23:10:45"
