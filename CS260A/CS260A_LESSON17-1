In CS260A_LESSON16 I talked about the "login" process, wtmp, utmp and btmp files.
As I already mentioned, these 3 files are in binary format and we can not use 
utilities such as "cat", "more" and  "less to display their contents. 

On most Linux distros, thew full paths for these 3 files are:

/var/run/utmp and /var/log/wtmp and /var/log/btmp.
But on some other systems they are located on /etc/utmp, /var/adm/wtmp, /etc/btmp .

The wtmp and utmp files are providing valuable information for many commands on
Unix/Linux systems such as "who", "w", and "utmpdump".  
We all are familiar with the "who" and "w" commands. In the following, I will talk
about "utmpdum" :

utmpdump is a utility to dump the system audit logs called utmp, wtmp, and btmp.
For example:

utmpdump /var/run/utmp 
utmpdump /var/log/wtmp
utmpdump /var/log/btmp

options are:

       -f, --follow
              Output appended data as the file grows.

       -o, --output file
              Write command output to file instead of standard output.

       -r, --reverse
              Undump, write back edited login information into the utmp or wtmp files.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.


Some examples:


Use the following command to convert the binary file into an editable file wtmp.file

utmpdump/var/log/wtmp >/var/log/wtmp.file

Now we can edit /var/log/wtmp.file to delete some login records, or modify login records


Now we can convert the file back to binary file

utmpdump  -r </var/log/wtmp.file >/var/log/wtmp

After the modification is completed, the last command can be used to view the
modification result.

/var/log/wtmp is usually rotated (or just cleared) by a monthly cron job, or with
a config file in /etc/logrotate.d/

For example: on the  Debian system, all the lines in /etc/logrotate.d/wtmp are 
commented out, but /etc/cron.monthly/acct (from the acct GNU Accounting Utilities
package) rotates it and generates a monthly report (/var/log/wtmp.report).

Check to see if you have /var/log/wtmp.1, /var/log/wtmp.2, etc. Possibly compressed
with .gz filename extensions.

You can use last's -f option to view the records in other wtmp files. e.g.

last -f /var/log/wtmp.1
From man last:

-f, --file file

Tell last to use a specific file instead of /var/log/wtmp. The --file option can
be given multiple times, and all of the specified files will be processed.

BTW, last -f can't read a compressed wtmp file. If it's compressed, you'll have to
gunzip it first.


Compressors
-----------

Compressors are programs that are compressing files. Compressed files are much 
smaller than the original files, and using less space.
There are several compressors in Unix/Linux, but gzip and bzip2 are among the most
popular ones.
The following site is talking about gzip:

And the following one is talking about bzip2:

Archiver
--------

Archiving is a process of placing group of files and folders in another file.
It is similar to place many of our items in our handbag or briefcase.
There are several archivers available in Unix/Linux, but among them, "tar"
and "cpio" are the most popular ones.
The following sites are discussing about the "tar" command:

And the following is talking about "cpio":
