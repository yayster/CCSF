The login command on Unix/Linux systems
---------------------------------------

On Unix-like operating systems, the login command begins a new login session on
the system.

The login program is used to establish a new session with the system. It is normally 
invoked automatically by responding to the "login:" prompt on the user's terminal.
login may be special to the shell and may not be invoked as a sub-process. When called
from a shell, login should be executed as exec login which will cause the user to
exit from the current shell (and thus will prevent the new logged in user to return
to the session of the caller). Attempting to execute login from any shell but the
login shell will produce an error message.

The user is then prompted for a password, where appropriate. Echoing is disabled to
prevent revealing the password. Only a small number of password failures are permitted
before login exits and the communications link is severed.

If password aging has been enabled for your account, you may be prompted for a new
password before proceeding. You will be forced to provide your old password and the
new password before continuing; refer to our passwd for more information.

Your user and group ID will be set according to their values in the /etc/passwd file.
The value for $HOME, $SHELL, $PATH, $LOGNAME, and $MAIL are set according to the
appropriate fields in the password entry. ulimit, umask and nice values may also be
set according to entries in the GECOS field.

On some installations, this file is like history for utmp file, i.e. it maintains the logs of all logged in and logged out users (in the past). The last command uses this file is like history for utmp file, i.e. it maintains the logs of all logged in and logged out users (in the past). The last command uses this file to display listing of last logged in users.is file to display listing of last logged in users.e environment variable $TERM will be initialized to the
terminal type on your tty line, as specified in /etc/ttytype.

An initialization script may also be executed; check the documentation of your command interpreter for information on init scripts.

On most Unix/Linux systems, the login program is being called by the getty program.

getty program
-------------

getty, short for "get tty", is a Unix program running on a host computer that manages
physical or virtual terminals (TTYs). When it detects a connection, it prompts for
a username and check whether the username is valid or not. If it is valid, then it
runs the 'login' program to authenticate the user.

/var/run/utmp and /var/log/wtmp files
-------------------------------------

Logging is an essential part of the Linux based operating systems. The system maintains
logs for activities on the system. Logs of users logged in and logged out are also
maintained by the system.

The files '/var/run/utmp' and '/var/log/wtmp' contains logs for logins and logouts.
These two files are binary files. You cannot see them with any text editor or pager
like 'less'. Some commands such as who and w use these files for their output.
The information for these files is provided by the login command.

/var/run/utmp file
This file contains information about the users who are currently logged onto the system.
Who command uses this file to display the logged in users:

/var/log/wtmp file
This file is like history for utmp file, i.e. it maintains the logs of all logged in and logged out users (in the past). The last command uses this file to display listing of last logged in users.

Please pay attention to the fact that utmp and wtmp are binary files, and we can not
use more or less, or cat commands to display their contents.
The "last" command is used to display the contents of wtmp and utmp files.

Another important file related to users logins is '/var/log/btmp'. This file contains
bad login attempts. This file is used by 'lastb' to be displayed.
btmp records only failed login attempts.
 
Examples:

To display utmp:
last -f /var/log/utmp

To display wtmp:
last -f /var/log/wtmp   

To display btmp:

last -f /var/log/btmp
