In this lesson, we would like to talk about /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.

/etc/passwd is a text file, readable by everybody, and writable by root.
This file keeps track of all of the users on the system. It simply means, each
user of the system should have a record in this file.
The records are sorted based on the numeric user-id. As a result, the very first
record belongs to the root with the user-id of zero.
Each record in this file consists of 7 fields and fields are separated by a semi-
colon. The following depicts the structure of a record in /etc/passwd:

login-id:password:user-id:group-id:comments:home_directory:shell

The first field is the user's login-id. For example, mine is "amoghtan".
The second field used to be the encrypted password for the user. But due to the
security issues, this field no longer keeps passwords. We normally put and "x" or
another character as a place holder.
The third field is the unique numeric user-id. For example mine is 952.
The forth field is the numeric group-id. Group-id does not need to be unique.
The fifth field is the comment field. We can put our full name, or address or
department or whatever. It can be also an empty field.
The sixth field is the home_directory field. It shows the full path of the user's
directory when he/she logins in to the system. 
The seventh field is the shell field. In this field we put the full path of the
shell we are using. For example:   /bin/bash or /bin/ksh  and so forth.
This field also could have the full path of the special shell script made by the
sys-admin. For example something like  /bin/nologin. This script normally displays
some message to the user, and then logs off the system.
If you have never seen your record in the password file, you might do it by this
command:

grep "^YOUR_LOGIN_ID"  /etc/passwd
For example,      grep "^amoghtan"  /etc/passwd
will display my record on hills.
To count number of all users on hills we should do:

cat /etc/passwd | wc -l
OR
wc -l < /etc/passwd

To show number of users who are using "bash", we should do:

grep "/bash$" /etc/passwd | wc -l

Or to count number of "nologin" accounts:

grep "nologin$" /etc/passwd | wc -l

There is a very good utility called "getent". This command can be used to display
/etc/passwd or /etc/group or any other system file. For example:

getent passwd
will display the entire /etc/passwd file. Or  
getent passwd  amoghtan
will display my record.
getent passwd | wc -l 
will count number of users.

Now lets talk about /etc/group file.
This file is taking care of all of the groups in the system. 
As you know, each user in unix/Linux should belong to at least one group.
Each group has its own record in the /etc/group file. The following shows the
structure of the /etc/group file:

group_name:password:group-id:group-members

The group_name has the name of the group. It is a non-numeric field.
The password field does not keep the password anymore. We normally put "x" as a 
place holder.
The group-id field is representing the numeric group-id. This field does not need
to be unique.
The group-members field consists of the login-id of all of all of the group members
separated by a comma.

At CCSF, each course is represented by a unique 5-digit number. This number is called
"CRN". For example 32569 is a CRN number.
Each course has a record in the /etc/group file. The group-name for each course
is the CRN of the course proceeded by a letter "c". For example "c32569"
The group-members are all the login-ids of all of the students who are taking
that course. The first group-member is the login-id of the instructor of the
course.
For example:

c32569:x:7351:amoghtan,amaceir1,bchew4,cfazio,cfigue43,clee362,ichan30,jhern441,jjacob7,jpetani,jseelapa,kcalero1,kgarc127,kmclare2,kserrafi,lfaulds,mmoy5,nmarks5,nmucks,nwarner7,rguzman5,rherrer4,rnyima,rrowleyi,ssitu29,ttekie1,wwong4,vrogov1,kmcalli1,oreising,kamara1,ljimen24,mbravo13,jkhosh,emolhi,sspeas

The following command would display the sorted login-ids of all of the students
in the course with the CRN of 32569:

getent group c32569 | cut -d: -f4 | tr ','  '\n' | sed '1d' | sort

Did you understand what these commands do ?

As I mentioned earlier in this lesson, the password fields in /etc/passwd and
/etc/group do not have any password. In the old good days, we had the unscripted
password in this field, but due to the security issues, the passwords are moved to
another file called /etc/shadow .
Unalike /etc/passwd and /etc/group, /etc/shadow is not readable by anybody. In fact
this file is not even a textual. There is a tool to read the file. In the
account management and account security subjects, I'll come beck to /etc/shadow
again, and discuss about this file in more detail.


How to make a bootable USB flash drive
--------------------------------------

There are several ways to make a bootable USB flash drive. The following
depicts some of them:

balenaEtcher
DasBoot	
Fedora 
GNOME Disks
GNU dd	
LinuxLive USB Creator (LiLi)
remastersys
Rufus
SliTaz TazUSB
Ubuntu Live USB creator
UNetbootin
Universal USB Installer (UUI)
Ventoy
Windows To Go

Using the dd command to create a USB bootable flash drive
---------------------------------------------------------
1) Find the device name of your flash drive

sudo lsblk

or 

df

The following is a sample of output of the df command on my machine:


Filesystem            1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
udev                   16432268       0  16432268   0% /dev
tmpfs                   3288884   26244   3262640   1% /run
/dev/mapper/md0_crypt 491076512 9641092 456420380   3% /
tmpfs                  16444408  105472  16338936   1% /dev/shm
tmpfs                      5120       4      5116   1% /run/lock
tmpfs                  16444408       0  16444408   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/sdc1             122546800  124876 116153868   1% /boot
tmpfs                   3288880      24   3288856   1% /run/user/119
tmpfs                   3288880      72   3288808   1% /run/user/1000
/dev/sdd1               1467360 1467360         0 100% /media/abbas/PENDRIVE

Please pay attention to the last line. So my device name is "/dev/sdd1"

2) unmount the device

sudo umount /dev/sdd1

3) Create a file system on your flash drive 

sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sdd1

4) create the USB flash drive now

sudo dd if=name-of-iso.iso of=/dev/sdd1  bs=1M status=progress
